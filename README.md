Educational Data Analytics - Classification Problem

## Introduction 

From the early 21st century many traditional third level institutions started offering online courses or weighing the options to do so. The rate of online learning tripled between 2000 and 2007 in the US alone [Means et.al,2013](https://www.tcrecord.org/Content.asp?ContentId=16882).

Higher education has become more and more expensive, and it is a competitive market for institutions. In 2020 the outbreak of a global pandemic caused an ‘educational catastrophe’. Many third level educational institutions were ‘forced’ to continue teaching on online platforms [UNESCO, 2020](https://en.unesco.org/news/secretary-general-warns-education-catastrophe-pointing-unesco-estimate-24-million-learners-risk). As a result, the already rapidly increasing rate towards online transition was further accelerated.

Educational data mining is an emerging field to discover new knowledge from data which originates from educational environments. As higher education is becoming more expensive and competitive, there is an increasing importance of data analytics methods within the industry.

In the years of 2013/2014 the Open University collected performance data from more than 30 thousand students across seven modules. The data showed that over 30% of students withdrew from a selected module and ?% failed their final exams. Dropout and failed students decrease the overall success rate of their institution which in turn can decrease its profitability. Moreover, it can negatively affect student experience within the institution. Student retention is one of the main objectives of educational learning analytics.

**Aim** of this study to apply data mining technologies and test accuracy and predicting quality of various supervised classifiers to identify dropout/failure risk students.
